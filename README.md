# Angular
[Angular](https://angular.io) presents a framework from Google for creating SPA client applications. One of the key features of Angular is that it uses TypeScript as the programming language. Therefore, before starting work, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the basics of this language. Angular presents not only tools, but also design templates for creating a serviced project. If you create the Angular application correctly, you wonâ€™t have any confusion of classes and methods that are hard to edit and even harder to test. The code is conveniently structured, you can quickly understand what's what.
